Definitions

The “Licensor” is the individual or entity that offers the Licensed Work under the terms of this License.

The “Licensed Work” is the software distributed by the Licensor under this License, or a derivative work thereof made by the Licensee.

The “Change License” is the license specified in the Parameters that will automatically replace this License as of the Change Date.

The “Change Date” is the date specified in the Parameters on which the Licensed Work will automatically be made available under the Change License.

“Use Limitation” is the limitation on offering or providing the Licensed Work as a service, specified in the Parameters.

“Additional Use Grant” is any additional permissions granted to you beyond those otherwise provided by this License, as specified in the Parameters.

License Grant

Subject to the Use Limitation, Licensor hereby grants you, free of charge, a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to use, copy, modify, create derivative works, and redistribute the Licensed Work, provided that:

1. You may use the Licensed Work solely for your internal business purposes and/or personal use;
2. You may not offer or make available the functionality of the Licensed Work to third parties as a service (or relicense, redistribute, or otherwise incorporate it into a service) subject to the Use Limitation, unless:
   - (a) such use is allowed under the Additional Use Grant; or
   - (b) you have a separate agreement with Licensor granting such use;
3. You must retain in all copies of the Licensed Work (including any modified or derivative works thereof) the text of this License, the copyright notices, and the disclaimers;
4. You must include the same license terms (including the Use Limitation and any Additional Use Grant) in any modified version or derivative work of the Licensed Work.

Change Date and Change License

On the Change Date, or upon a material breach of these terms by the Licensor, this License will automatically terminate and be replaced by the Change License for the Licensed Work. Before that time, Licensor may, at its sole discretion, release the Licensed Work under the Change License earlier than the Change Date.

If the Change License specified in the Parameters is a commonly recognized open source license, any obligations or restrictions in this License that are not found in the Change License will no longer apply, and your rights in the Licensed Work will be governed exclusively by the Change License.

Additional Use Grant

If the Parameters specify an Additional Use Grant, you may engage in uses of the Licensed Work authorized by such Additional Use Grant, subject to the terms of that grant. If the Additional Use Grant contains conditions, you must comply with those conditions. If the Additional Use Grant is removed or changed by the Licensor, that removal or change will not alter your rights that have already been granted under the Additional Use Grant prior to the date of removal or change.

Warranty Disclaimer

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS. LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND TITLE.

Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability

While redistributing the Licensed Work or modified or derivative works thereof, you may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations, and/or additional rights consistent with this License. However, in doing so, you may act only on your own behalf and at your own responsibility, not on behalf of Licensor, and only if you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Licensor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, Licensor as a result of your offering these warranties or additional rights.

Termination

Any use of the Licensed Work in violation of the Use Limitation, or any material breach of this License, will automatically terminate this License. If you violate the Use Limitation, you lose all rights under it immediately.

Severability

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

Entire Agreement

This License constitutes the entire agreement between you and Licensor with respect to the Licensed Work. It supersedes any prior agreements, negotiations, or understandings regarding the Licensed Work.
