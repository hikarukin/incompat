Server Side Public License, v 1

January 16, 2019

This version of the Server Side Public License (the "License") applies to
the program or other work to which it is attached (the "Work").  Throughout
this License, the copyright holder(s) is referred to as "Licensor".

1. Definitions

"Copyleft Condition" means a requirement stated in Section 13 of this License.

"Copyrightable Work" means any work subject to copyright under Applicable
Law. A work results from a modification of a Copyrightable Work, or from
the combining of a Copyrightable Work with other works, if it is
prepared such that the applicable copyright holder(s) of the
Copyrightable Work would have a basis under Applicable Law (including,
where applicable, under doctrines of partial or entire compilation or
derivative works) for asserting rights in the resulting work. However,
no work is considered a "modification" or "combination" for purposes of
this License merely because it was designed to be used with the Work or
because it enables interoperability with the Work (e.g., using or
enabling an API, plugin, or module for the Work).

"Service" means making the functionality of the Work (or any modified
version of the Work) available to third parties as a service.

"User" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
License to the Work or to a modified version of the Work.

"Applicable Law" means any law, regulation, or similar government mandate
that applies to you and/or to the Work, now or in the future.

2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, for the duration of
copyright in the Work, Licensor hereby grants you a non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce the Work, prepare
modifications and/or combinations of the Work, publicly display and
perform the Work, and distribute and sublicense the Work and any
modifications and/or combinations.

3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, for the duration of
any patent claims licensable by Licensor that would be infringed by
making, using, or selling the Work, Licensor hereby grants you a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license to make, have
made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer the Work
and any modifications and/or combinations. The foregoing license applies
only to the extent that such patent claims would be infringed by the
Work itself or by its modifications and/or combinations.

4. Limitations

Subject to the exceptions set forth in Section 13, you may not exercise
the rights granted under this License to publicly distribute or publicly
perform the Work or a modified version of the Work if you have not
complied with the Copyleft Condition in Section 13.

5. Redistribution

You may distribute a copy of the Work or a modified version of the Work
in any medium, provided that you retain the above copyright notice(s),
this License, and all license notices and other disclaimers.

6. No Surrender of Others' Freedom

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Work at all.

7. Trademarks

Nothing in this License grants permission to use any trademark, service
mark, or trade name of Licensor. You may indicate that a modified version
of the Work is modified by you and not by Licensor.

8. Termination

If you violate any of the terms and conditions in this License, then any
rights granted to you by this License may be terminated. You may retain
a copy of the Work thereafter only if you have not distributed or
otherwise made the Work available to the public in breach of this License.

9. Disclaimer of Warranty

THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN
NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK OR THE USE OR OTHER
DEALINGS IN THE WORK.

10. Limitation of Liability

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE
LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE
OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

11. Acceptance

No act other than your compliance with this License (including its
Copyleft Condition in Section 13) constitutes acceptance of this
License. You expressly waive any right to acceptance of this License by
means of any electronic contracting mechanism or otherwise.

12. General

If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
by the parties to this License, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

13. Copyleft Condition

You must make the Source Code of all modifications and/or combinations
that you create, use, or provide (directly or through others) to a third
party, under the Work, publicly available under the terms of this
License within thirty (30) days after the date you provide or deploy the
modifications and/or combinations, and at no charge to all third
parties. The Source Code must be delivered in a manner readily accessible
to all third parties, including but not limited to, sending along a
copy, a link, or a written indication of where the Source Code can be
found.

"Source Code" means the form of the Work preferred for making modifications,
including but not limited to software source code, documentation source,
configuration files, scripts, or interface definition files.
